//! The bodies of the "delete project?" and "remove project?" confirmations,
//! built once as prose for both surfaces, and the status lines that answer
//! them, built from parts so a toast can chip the project's name.
//!
//! The terminal UI renders them in its Confirm Delete Project and Confirm
//! Remove Project dialogs, and the browser's `lib/projectConfirm.ts` builds the
//! same segments for `DeleteProjectDialog` and `RemoveProjectDialog`. The two
//! are pinned against each other by `tests/fixtures/prose_cross_language.json`.
//!
//! `project_name` is `None` only where a surface has no name to show; the
//! sentence then says "this project" rather than inventing one.
