//! Keeps every test away from the developer's real agent CLIs.
//!
//! A test that drives agent creation or a launch with the stock provider table
//! would otherwise exec the real `claude` (or `codex`, `opencode`, `copilot`)
//! found on the developer's `PATH`, in whatever directory the test happened to
//! point it at, including the home directory. Two halves stop that:
//!
//! - [`defuse_config`] and [`harmless_config`] give the shared test fixtures a
//!   provider table whose names are the stock ones but whose command is a plain
//!   `cat` behind `sh`, so a test that needs "the claude provider" keeps the name
//!   and launches nothing real. They also point terminals at a plain `sh`, since
//!   a terminal's default command is the machine's `$SHELL` and it spawns
//!   through the same guarded chokepoint.
//! - [`refuse_unlisted_spawn`] is called from the PTY spawn chokepoint in test
//!   builds only, and refuses to exec any command that is not one of the
//!   [`ALLOWED_TEST_COMMANDS`]. Any CLI can be a provider, so a list of the agent
//!   CLIs we know about could never be complete; the allowlist names the few
//!   harmless programs tests genuinely run instead. A fixture that forgets the
//!   first half fails its launch instead of starting a real agent.
//!
//! The same allowlist covers every program dux starts OUTSIDE a PTY that a
//! developer would see or feel: the "open in editor" launch, the browser and
//! file opener, and the shell a project's startup command runs through.
//! [`refuse_unlisted_launch`] is called from each of those chokepoints in test
//! builds, [`detect_installed_editors`](crate::editor::detect_installed_editors)
//! reports only stand-in editors whose command is [`HARMLESS_EDITOR_COMMAND`]
//! instead of scanning `PATH`, and [`defuse_config`] points the startup-command
//! shell at a plain `sh`. Git, `gh` and `tailscale` are plumbing the suites fake
//! or need, and are not routed through it.
//!
//! Compiled only for dux-core's own tests and for the `test-support` feature that
//! `dux-tui` and `dux-web` enable as a dev-dependency, so none of it ships.
