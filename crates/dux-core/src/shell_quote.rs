//! POSIX shell quoting for text dux shows a user to paste into a shell.
//!
//! One rule, shared by every caller: wrap in single quotes, inside which
//! nothing is special, and spell an embedded apostrophe as `'\''` (close the
//! quote, an escaped apostrophe, reopen). Double quotes are not enough: `$`,
//! backticks and a closing `"` stay live inside them, so a crafted name would
//! run a command of its own. The web's `lib/shellQuote.ts` applies the same
//! rule.

/// `s` as ONE POSIX shell word, whatever it contains.
