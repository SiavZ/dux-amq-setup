/**
 * The phone's theater choreography, ticking. One phase for the whole gesture, mounted once
 * per pane screen: the flap and the pill render from it, so "which cluster exists right now"
 * cannot have two answers, and a screen that hands over to another runs none of its own.
 *
 * A flight runs when the mode MOVES, and only then: a page that opens in theater has no dock
 * to fly a control in from. That is asked as "did the mode change", never as a first-run
 * latch, which React's strict mode spends on the first of its two effect invocations and so
 * flies a phantom leaving gesture on every mount.
 *
 * A mode that flips back mid-gesture is asked of the stage in flight (`flightForModeFrom`),
 * and reduced motion is read through a ref rather than a dependency, so a system setting
 * changing mid-page cannot restart a gesture over a mode that never moved.
 *
 * A full-pane cover arriving or leaving moves the chrome too, and that one is deliberately
 * an instant swap: there is nothing to fly, because the pill the cluster would travel as is
 * withheld under such a cover, and half a flight with neither end painted is worse than the
 * flap simply being there.
